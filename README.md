# Single Pixel Camera

Arduino files move the stepper and the servo motor to capture a 300x300 pixel image. 
Additionally, a light intensity probe, TEMT6000, was used to record brightness. In order
to get color, RGB filters were used in front of the sensor.

The java program displays this information in a GUI, with a contour map, and a real-time
display of the image being created.
